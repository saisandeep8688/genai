## 2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think, learn, and make decisions using data and algorithms.

### Key Characteristics
- Data-driven learning (Machine Learning, Deep Learning)  
- Pattern recognition and prediction  
- High-speed processing  
- Automation and scalability  
- Consistent and repeatable decisions  

### Example
An AI system detecting fraud by analyzing millions of transactions in seconds.
